# First Tutorial
This is your first tutorial for building an iOS app.
## IDE Setup
Download and install the Xcode IDE via the App Store:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12
> When you try to open Xcode, you may be prompted to "Install Additional Components" If that is the case, click "Install"

## Creating a new project
When you first open Xcode, you will see the menu below:

<img src="https://github.com/SiGMobileUIUC/HelloWorldiOS/blob/master/Resources/Images/XcodeOpen.png" width="400">

From here, you should select `Create a new Xcode Project`. Next, a dropdown menu will appear, allowing you to choose what kind of app you want. For now, let's choose `Single View Application`

Next, we'll be given options for how we want this app to be configured. Set up your configuration to match this one:

[OPTIONAL] This is what each field is for:
* Product name: The name of your app. This will be the name users see
* Team: If you are working with/for an Apple Developer, this dropdown will "sign" this app with their information, allowing it to be published to the app store
* Organization name: This identifies who is working on this app for the app store
* Organization identifier: A unique identifier for each app posted to the app store. This is typically also where users can get more information about the app. Notice that it is in reverse www notation. For example, acm.illinois.edu is edu.illinois.acm in this scenario
* Language: If for some reason you *really* want to work in Objective-C, this option allows you to do so. Keep in mind these tutorials are for Swift
* User Interface: Apple recently released SwiftUI in 2019. Since then, you've been able to choose between the old way of building user interfaces (storyboards) and the new way (SwiftUI). Our tutorials are for SwiftUI, but many older apps still use storboards
* Use Core Data/Use CloudKit: This allows your app to store data in a local (or cloud-based) database for users.
* Include Unit Tests: Basically CS126 in a nutshell
* Include UI Tests: Unit tests for the UI. This allows you to ensure users can press buttons and that elements are visible for all devices

Finally, you'll be prompted with where to save your project. Obviously, this is up to you. Also during this step, there's a checkbox to initialize a git repository. If you know how git works, it is recommended you enable it. If not, ask someone! (or look at the tutorial) Git is a fantastic tool.

## Setting up your workspace
When you first open up your project, Xcode should look something like this:

<img src="https://github.com/SiGMobileUIUC/HelloWorldiOS/blob/master/Resources/Images/MainView.png" width="800">

First, in the righthand window pane, hit "Resume" towards the top to get a preview of what your app will look like. Once you do this, you'll probably see an iPhone SE2. If you want to change the device you're working on, click the dropdown menu in the top left, select your new device, and hit resume again.

I decided to use the iPhone 11 Pro, so my preview looks like this:

## Making your first changes

This page looks a little boring, so we're going to spruce it up. First off, let's make some changes to the Hello, World! label by changing the font and foreground color.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .font(.title)
            .foregroundColor(.orange)
    }
}
```
> As you can see above, adding a `.` after the **element** (in this case `Text`) allows us to add **modifiers** to it. For now we're going to make the font bigger, and we're going to make the text color orange. Notice that the `.title` and `.orange` both have `.` in front of them. That's because they are **properties**. So, in short, **elements** can have **modifiers** apply **properties** to them.
Notice how as you added attributes, the live preview automatically updates.

Now, while that does look a lot better, orange on white is pretty hard to read, so we're going to make our background Illini themed:
```
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .font(.title)
            .foregroundColor(.orange)
            .background(Color.blue)
    }
}
```

That looks a lot better! However, I don't like how close the borders are and how sharp the corners are. Let's change those too!
```
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .font(.title)
            .foregroundColor(.orange)
            .background(Color.blue)
            .padding()
            .cornerRadius(10)
    }
}
```
Huh. We added padding (extra space around an element), and even set the `cornerRadius` to 10 but nothing changed? This is because in SwiftUI, the order in which you apply modifiers matters. Right now, we're putting padding around an object with a background. What we want to do is apply a background to an object with padding:
```
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .font(.title)
            .foregroundColor(.orange)
            .padding()
            .background(Color.blue)
            .cornerRadius(10)
    }
}
```

Much better. Looking back at what we did before though, I think the vertical spacing on the background was fine. See if you can find a **property** to make your text look like this:
